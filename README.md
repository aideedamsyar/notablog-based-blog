## Leveraging Notablog for My Digital Space [aideedamsyar.com](https://aideedamsyar.com)

My digital journal, [aideedamsyar.com](https://aideedamsyar.com), thrives on [Notablog](https://github.com/dragonman225/notablog), a very unique platform that turns Notion workspaces into sleek, static websites. What sets Notablog apart is its straightforwardness and functionality, enabling creators like me to effortlessly curate our stories directly within Notion.

### The Essence of Notablog ðŸŒŸ

- **Intuitive Notion Integration**: With Notablog, the synergy between creating content in Notion and managing a blog is unparalleled, offering a seamless experience for those of us who are Notion nerds.
- **Tailored Designs**: The platform provides a suite of adaptable templates, granting the freedom to mold the aesthetic and functional aspects of our sites to our liking. For me, I have always been into Notion's layout but unfortunately using Notion by itself for producing and putting it on the web is just not that ideal.
- **Efficient Static Site Generation**: Swift static site generation with simplicity within itself.

### How It Works ðŸ”§

1. **Content Origination**: In my Notion, each blog post is crafted as a distinct page, allowing for organized content creation and management.
2. **Transformation Process**: Utilizing Notablog, I execute a command-line operation to transmute the content from my Notion workspace into a static website structure. This process involves parsing the Notion pages, applying the selected template, and rendering them into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, using EJS.
3. **Web Deployment**: Once the static site is prepared, I deploy it to the web. This step often involves pushing the generated site files to a GitHub repository and using GitHub Pages or a similar service (like Netlify or Vercel) to serve the content to visitors worldwide.
